# Git

An Open-source collaborative version control system that is often used for source code management.
Git is structured as a shared repository that utilizes branches to track changes in code.

## Repository
A location where we can store code.
Git has two types of repositories:

### Remote/Central
The canonical/official copy of the code and all of it's versions.
Usually located in the cloud. [our repository](http://gitlab.com/revature_batches/2012-dec14-react)

### Local
The copy of that remote repository that exists on your machine.

Clone remote repository to our local machine:
`git clone http://gitlab.com/revature_batches/2012-dec14-react`
